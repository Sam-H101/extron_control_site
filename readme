## Created By Sam Hudnall Starting on 7/2017 ###########
########################################################
## Purpose and Intent: Control extron recording        #
## Machines throughout campus, and allow various users #
## To connect and start / stop from one panel. This    #
## Will allow the full locking of the panels and allow #
## Them to be set up once. Their is a lower chance that#
## A Recording will be left running due to others      #
## Forgetting to turn the machine off.                 #
########################################################
## First iteration: Setup pages and get functional.    #
## Not too worried about page looks and overall feel   #
## Until core components are running and are able to be#
## Used at a consistant rate.                          # 
## ----------------------------------------------------#
## Second iteration: Clean up panel and make functions #
## Easier and smoother to complete.                    #
########################################################
## Limitations: Unable to actually talk with units to  #
## Receive feedback. It is coded in there where it can #
## Listen, however it will make talk time slow and     #
## Possibly fail to send commands.                     #
